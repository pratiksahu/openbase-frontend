import { GoalCategory, GoalPriority } from '@/types/smart-goals.types';

const { createGoal } = useGoals();

const newGoal = await createGoal({
  title: "Learn React and TypeScript",
  description: "Master modern React development with TypeScript",
  category: GoalCategory.PROFESSIONAL,
  priority: GoalPriority.HIGH,
  measurable: {
    metricType: MetricType.PERCENTAGE,
    targetValue: 100,
    unit: "completion"
  },
  timebound: {
    startDate: new Date(),
    targetDate: new Date('2024-12-31')
  }
});
```

#### Tracking Progress
```typescript
import { useMetrics } from '@/hooks/useMetrics';

const { addCheckpoint } = useMetrics(goalId);

await addCheckpoint({
  goalId,
  value: 75,
  note: "Completed advanced concepts module",
  recordedDate: new Date()
});
```

#### Managing Tasks
```typescript
import { useTasks } from '@/hooks/useTasks';

const { tasks, addTask, updateTaskStatus } = useTasks(goalId);

const newTask = await addTask({
  goalId,
