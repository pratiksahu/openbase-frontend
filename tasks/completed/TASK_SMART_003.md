# Task SMART-003: BreakdownTree Component

## Objective
Create a hierarchical tree component for visualizing and managing the goal breakdown structure with collapsible nodes, drag-and-drop, and quick actions.

## Prerequisites
- [ ] Complete TASK_SMART_001 (Type Definitions)
- [ ] Verify react-dnd or similar library availability
- [ ] Check if tree components exist in shadcn/ui
- [ ] Review existing component patterns

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Component Structure
- [ ] Create directory `components/BreakdownTree/`
- [ ] Create `BreakdownTree.tsx` main component
- [ ] Create `TreeNode.tsx` for individual nodes
- [ ] Create `TreeActions.tsx` for quick actions
- [ ] Create `TreeContext.tsx` for state management
- [ ] Create `BreakdownTree.types.ts`
- [ ] Create `BreakdownTree.utils.ts`
- [ ] Create `index.ts` barrel export

### 2. Tree Data Structure
- [ ] Implement tree traversal utilities:
  - `flattenTree()` - convert to flat list
  - `buildTree()` - convert from flat to tree
  - `findNode()` - locate node by ID
  - `getNodePath()` - get breadcrumb path
- [ ] Add node manipulation functions:
  - `addNode()` - insert new node
  - `removeNode()` - delete with children
  - `moveNode()` - reorder/reparent
  - `updateNode()` - modify properties

### 3. TreeNode Component
- [ ] Create expandable/collapsible node
- [ ] Add indentation based on depth
- [ ] Implement node selection state
- [ ] Add hover effects
- [ ] Include node type indicators:
  - Goal icon
  - Outcome icon
  - Milestone icon
  - Task icon
- [ ] Add status indicators
- [ ] Include progress bar for completion

### 4. Tree Interactions
- [ ] Implement expand/collapse all
- [ ] Add keyboard navigation:
  - Arrow keys for navigation
  - Space for toggle
  - Enter for selection
- [ ] Add multi-select with Ctrl/Cmd
- [ ] Implement search/filter
- [ ] Add focus management

### 5. Drag and Drop
- [ ] Set up drag-and-drop context
- [ ] Implement draggable nodes
- [ ] Add drop zones with validation
- [ ] Show drop preview
- [ ] Validate move operations:
  - Prevent circular dependencies
  - Respect hierarchy rules
- [ ] Update tree after drop

### 6. Quick Actions
- [ ] Create action menu component
- [ ] Implement "Split" action:
  - Convert to multiple subtasks
  - Maintain relationships
- [ ] Implement "Promote" action:
  - Move up hierarchy level
- [ ] Implement "Demote" action:
  - Move down hierarchy level
- [ ] Add "Convert to Subgoal"
- [ ] Include "Add Metric" shortcut
- [ ] Add delete with confirmation

### 7. Tree Visualization
- [ ] Add connection lines between nodes
- [ ] Implement smooth animations:
  - Expand/collapse transitions
  - Drag animations
  - Reorder animations
- [ ] Add empty state message
- [ ] Include loading skeleton
- [ ] Support large trees (virtualization)

### 8. Storybook Stories
- [ ] Create `BreakdownTree.stories.tsx`
- [ ] Add empty tree story
- [ ] Add single-level tree story
- [ ] Add multi-level complex tree
- [ ] Add interactive drag-drop story
- [ ] Add large dataset story (performance)
- [ ] Add dark mode story
- [ ] Add action menu examples

### 9. Component Tests
- [ ] Create `BreakdownTree.test.tsx`
- [ ] Test tree rendering
- [ ] Test expand/collapse functionality
- [ ] Test node selection
- [ ] Test drag and drop operations
- [ ] Test quick actions
- [ ] Test keyboard navigation
- [ ] Test tree utilities

### 10. Playwright E2E Tests
- [ ] Create `tests/breakdown-tree.spec.ts`
- [ ] Test tree expansion/collapse
- [ ] Test node selection (single/multi)
- [ ] Test drag and drop operations
- [ ] Test quick actions menu
- [ ] Test keyboard navigation
- [ ] Test search/filter
- [ ] Test large tree performance
- [ ] Test accessibility features

## Testing Checklist

### Pre-Implementation Testing
- [ ] Run existing tests: `npx playwright test`
- [ ] Verify TypeScript: `npm run typecheck`
- [ ] Check Storybook: `npm run storybook`

### Component Testing
- [ ] Tree renders with correct hierarchy
- [ ] Nodes expand/collapse properly
- [ ] Selection state works correctly
- [ ] Drag and drop functions properly
- [ ] Quick actions execute correctly
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works
- [ ] Search/filter functions
- [ ] Animations are smooth

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Works with mock data
- [ ] Storybook stories all function
- [ ] No memory leaks with large trees
- [ ] Proper event handling
- [ ] State management works correctly

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Test with 100+ nodes
- [ ] Measure render time
- [ ] Check memory usage
- [ ] Verify smooth scrolling
- [ ] Test animation performance

### Accessibility Testing
- [ ] Keyboard navigation complete
- [ ] Screen reader compatible
- [ ] ARIA labels present
- [ ] Focus management correct
- [ ] Color contrast sufficient

### Regression Testing
- [ ] All existing tests pass: `npx playwright test`
- [ ] No linting errors: `npm run lint`
- [ ] Build succeeds: `npm run build`
- [ ] No console errors

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Tree accurately represents hierarchy
- [ ] All interactions are intuitive
- [ ] Performance with 500+ nodes acceptable
- [ ] Drag and drop is smooth
- [ ] Quick actions work reliably
- [ ] Fully keyboard accessible
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No regression in existing features

## Rollback Plan
If issues arise:
1. Remove component directory
2. Revert package.json changes
3. Remove test files
4. Clear any added dependencies
5. Verify existing tests pass

## Notes
- Consider using react-arborist or similar for complex tree logic
- Implement virtualization for large trees
- Use CSS Grid/Flexbox for layout
- Keep actions consistent with design system
- Document tree operation complexity
